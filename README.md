# Ticket tracker for local projects

A basic ticket tracking system for local projects

```
$ ticket "This will go in the main body of the ticket
> everything between the quotes will be included."
```
This will create a new ticket in the `{$HOME}/.tickets/{project_name}`

everything between the quotes will be included.
